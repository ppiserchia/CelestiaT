# CelestiaT
CelestiaT is an app that collects stories and experiences of the trans community and presents them in the shape of stars and constellations, allowing other people to explore them and feel connected through the visual representation and shared struggles and victories.

# How does it work?

## Onboarding
The first thing the user is going to see is the **Onboarding**.

In it, we wanted to provide a brief description of the experience the user can expect!

## Main view
The next stage is a pinch-able view that holds the personal constellations, made out of as many stars as the stories that specific person shared.

As you tap on each constellation, another view will open where you can read said stories as you scroll left and right.
